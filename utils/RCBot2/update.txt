
0.53
- fixed: bots roaming instead of defending issue
- fixed: reduced engineer wrenching distance

Snipers still face wrong way

0.52
- sniper changes (they shoot more with sniper rifle) -- bug still exists where they face the wrong direction sometimes
- snipers no longer look around to listen to sounds when sniping
- fixed possible engineer crashes
- fixed possible medic crash
- fixed possible divide by zero crash
- added support for defend waypoints on PL/PLR map scripts
- rcbot waypoint load <mapname> command, (use "rcbot waypoint save" after loading)
- added 'class' in bot profiles
- medics keep healing if looking away from healing player

 issues/todo:
  [] spies still cannot sap (*engine issue?)
  [] demo's cannot set pipe traps (yet)  
  [] bots don't always use teleports (some situations only)

 KNOWN limitations:
  All of these limitations are effects of the Orange Box SDK lack 
  of 3rd party bot support, which are caused by the double speed/double 
  timing issue:
 
    [] bots still cannot crouch 
    [] pyro's flame still does not show
    [] sometimes engineers can't select wrench
     [] other bots sometimes can't select the weapon they want
      [] sometimes bots use melee weapon from long range
    [] soldier rocket jumps are not perfect
    [] scout double jumps are not perfect
    [] bots can still move when bonked
